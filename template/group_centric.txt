Group Centric Paradigm
Tim Riley (October, 1, 2023)

Purpose
-------
The purpose of the group centric paradigm is to give multiple
Linux users write access to only collaborating directories and files.
Non-collaborating users will not have even read access.

Vocabulary
----------
* User:	   Every login account has one user name.
* Group:   Every user name belongs to one or more groups.
	   Every group has a group name.
* World:   Every user belongs to the world.
	   The world does not have a name.
	   Instead, it is represented by the letter 'o'.

Process
-------
Collaborating users need group write access to collaborating
directories.
* Add collaborating groups to /etc/group.
* Add collaborating users to groups in /etc/group.

Set umask
---------
* Set umask to 0002 in /etc/profile.
* This instructs Linux to turn on the group write bit for new files
  and directories. It also instructs Linux to not turn on the world
  write bit.

File creation without group centric
-----------------------------------
* User:		receives full permissions
* Group:	receives restricted permissions
* World:	receives restricted permissions

File creation with group centric
--------------------------------
* User:		receives full permissions
* Group:	receives full permissions
* World:	receives read and execute permissions

Access management
-----------------
1) Assign each new user to a group name that is the same as the user name.
   This habit allows new users to not have to belong to a collaborating
   group.
2) Each user may be assigned to more groups in the /etc/group file.
3) For each collaborating directory, set the group name: chgrp $group .
4) For each collaborating directory, set the group SUID bit: chmod g+s .
5) For each collaborating directory, set the group write bit: chmod g+w .

The group SUID bit for a directory instructs Linux to change the behavior
for new files and subdirectories. Instead of setting the group name
to the user's group name, it sets the group name to the directory's
group name.

Each new file will have the group write bit turned on because umask
is 0002. The new file's group name will be the group name of the directory.
The world can read and/or execute the file.

Likewise, each new subdirectory will have the group write bit turned
on because umask is 0002.  Moreover, the subdirectory's group SUID bit
will be turned on.  The subdirectory's group name will be the group
name of its parent directory, not the group name of the user.
